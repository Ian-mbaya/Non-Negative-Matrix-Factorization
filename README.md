**Data Preprocessing and Analysis:**
Loading the training and test datasets for both RNA and ADT (antibody-derived tags).
Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the structure and content of the datasets.

**Model Implementation and Evaluation:**
Model Selection: Choosing regression techniques for predicting protein expression.
Model Training & Implementation: Implementing Simple Linear Regression.
Model Interpretation: Understanding the coefficients and predictions of the model.
Model Validation and Performance Evaluation: Splitting the data for cross-validation and calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) for model evaluation.

**Performing Dimensionality Reduction:**
Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Least Squares methods for dimensionality reduction.
Predicting protein expression using these reduced-dimension models and calculating MSE for evaluation.
